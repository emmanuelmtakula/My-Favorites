    <p>
      South Park is an animated tv show that is more offensive and uses comedy
      to offend and make fun of people. The main characters are 4 kids in grade
      4 names Stan, Kyle, Eric, and Kenny. They live in a small town called
      South Park where something interesting is always happening every episode.
      Some key things about the show I like are:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        The producers use humor to ridicule and make fun of people in real life.
      </li>

      <li>The show expresses world issues in a humorous way.</li>

      <li>The producers are not afraid to offend people with their jokes.</li>

      <li>
        The 4 characters have diverse personality traits and have different ways
        of thinking.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I enjoy working out in the gym because it is a way to challenge myself and
      improve myself at the same time. The gym challenges me because I do
      multiple workouts that are not comfortable. The gym is for anyone and
      everyone and theres many things to do at the gym such as:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Doing weight training and lifting weights for muscle growth.</li>
      <li>Doing cardio with the great selection of machines.</li>
      <li>Training with a personal trainer to achieve your goals.</li>
      <li>Doing any sport specific training.</li>
    </ul>
